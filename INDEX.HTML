    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">Markup language</a>  <sup>[a]</sup>for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web content</a>.It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.</p>
    <BR>
    <P>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</P>
</br>
    <P>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.  surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</P>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.<SUP>[4]</SUP> Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.<sup>[5]</sup></p>

<h4>Tim Berners-Lee</h4>
<p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 <i>Techniques for using SGML,</i> which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
<br>
Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[10][11] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.<sup>[12]</sup>
<br>
After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.<sup>[13]</sup>
<br>

Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<sup>[14]</sup> In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.<sup>[15]</sup>

        <li>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)

            <li>anuary 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
            
        </ul>
        
    </ul>
    <p>Initially code-named "Cougar",<sup>[18] </sup> HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.<sup>[20]</sup></p>
<h5>April 24, 1998</h5>
<P>HTML 4.0<SUP>[21]</SUP> was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.</P>
<h5>December 24, 1999</h5>
<P>HTML 4.01<SUP>[22]</SUP> was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata<sup>[23]</sup> were published on May 12, 2001.</P>
<h5>May 2000</h5>
<p>ISO/IEC 15445:2000sup<sup>[24] </sup>("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.<sup>[25]</sup>In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_JTC_1/SC_34" >ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 </a>(ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).<sup>[24]</sup></p>
